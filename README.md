# AEM_Cylinder_Fluid_Dynamics

This is an application to model the flow of a fluid around a series of impermeable cylinders. It shows streamlines (the path that the fluid takes as it flows past the impermeable cylinders) and pressure gradients. 

The solution is based on the Analytic Element Method and Complex Variable Method developed by Otto DL Strack. 

The assignment is outlined in Project Documentation > Final Project Assignment.pdf while the solution is described in Project Documentation > Final Project 2 Presentation.pptx

Scripts to run the application are located in the Scripts folder and are separated into Part 1 and Part 2 of the assignment.

Generated images are images used in the Final Project 2 Presentation file.
